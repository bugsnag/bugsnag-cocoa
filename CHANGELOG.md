## TBD

### Bug Fixes

* Fix stack trace resolution on iPhone XS sometimes reporting incorrect
  addresses
  [#319](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/319)

## 5.17.0 (2018-09-25)

### Enhancements

* Capture trace of error reporting thread and identify with boolean flag
  [#303](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/303)

### Bug Fixes

* Prevent potential crash in session delivery during app teardown
  [#308](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/308)


## 5.16.4 (13 Sept 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* Ensure NSException is captured when handler is overridden
  [#313](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/313)

* Fix mach handler declaration and imports. This resolves an issue where signal
  codes were less specific than is possible.
  [#314](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/314)

* Only call previously installed C++ termination handler if non-null. Fixes an
  unexpected termination if you override the handler with null before
  initializing Bugsnag and then throw a C++ exception and would like the app to
  continue after Bugsnag completes exception reporting.


## 5.16.3 (14 Aug 2018)

### Bug Fixes

  request to be delivered on the calling thread when automatic session tracking
  is enabled
  [#295](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/295)

## 5.16.1 (11 Jul 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* Respect appVersion override when serialising KSCrash report [#292](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/292)

## 5.16.0 (02 Jul 2018)

This release alters the behaviour of the notifier to track sessions automatically.
A session will be automatically captured on each app launch and sent to [https://sessions.bugsnag.com](https://sessions.bugsnag.com).

If you use Bugsnag On-Premise, it is now also recommended that you set your notify and session endpoints via `config.setEndpoints(notify:sessions:)`. The previous properties used to configure this, `config.notifyURL` and `config.sessionURL`, are now `readonly` and therefore no longer assignable.

* Enable automatic session tracking by default [#286](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/286)

### Bug Fixes

* Handle potential nil content value in RegisterErrorData class [#289](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/289)

## 5.15.6 (30 May 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* Ensure device data is attached to minimal reports [#279](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/279)
* Enforce requiring API key to initialise notifier [#280](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/280)

## 5.15.5 (25 Apr 2018)

### Bug Fixes

* Changes report generation so that when a minimal or incomplete crash is recorded, essential app/device information is included in the report on the next application launch. [#239](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/239)
[#250](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/250)

* Ensure timezone is serialised in report payload.

## 5.15.4 (21 Feb 2018)

This release adds additional device metadata for filtering by whether an error
occurred in a simulator ([#242](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/242))
and by processor word size ([#228](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/228)).

  [#245](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/245)
  [Jamie Lynch](https://github.com/fractalwrench)
* Re-addapp name to the app tab of reports
  [#244](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-cocoa/pull/244)

  the assertion type into the report's `errorClass`

change only affects users setting a custom `onCrash` handler to be executed at
