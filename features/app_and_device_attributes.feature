  Scenario: App and Device info is as expected when overridden via config
    When I run "AppAndDeviceAttributesScenarioConfigOverride"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API

  Scenario: Duration value increments as expected
    When I run "AppDurationScenario"
    And I wait to receive 3 errors
    And the event "app.duration" is between 0 and 200
    And I discard the oldest error
    And the event "app.duration" is between 2600 and 2800
    And I discard the oldest error
    And the event "app.duration" is between 5400 and 5600

  Scenario: isLaunching should be true if launchDurationMillis is 0
    When I run "AppAndDeviceAttributesInfiniteLaunchDurationScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    And the event "app.isLaunching" is true

  Scenario: isLaunching is true for unhandled exception during launch
