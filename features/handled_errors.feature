Feature: Handled Errors and Exceptions

Background:
    Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"

Scenario: Override errorClass and message from a notifyError() callback, customize report

    Discard 2 lines from the stacktrace, as we have single place to report and log errors, see
    https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/ios-objc/reporting-handled-exceptions/#depth
    This way top of the stacktrace is not logError but run
    Include configured metadata dictionary into the report

    When I run "HandledErrorOverrideScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "Bar"
    And the exception "message" equals "Foo"
    And the event "device.time" is within 30 seconds of the current timestamp
    And the event "metaData.account.items.0" equals 400
    And the event "metaData.account.items.1" equals 200
    And the "method" of stack frame 0 demangles to "iOSTestApp.HandledErrorOverrideScenario.run() -> ()"
    And the stack trace is an array with 15 stack frames

Scenario: Reporting an NSError
    When I run "HandledErrorScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "NSError"
    And the exception "message" equals "The operation couldnâ€™t be completed. (HandledErrorScenario error 100.)"
    And the stack trace is an array with 15 stack frames

Scenario: Reporting a handled exception
    When I run "HandledExceptionScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "HandledExceptionScenario"
    And the exception "message" equals "Message: HandledExceptionScenario"
    And the stack trace is an array with 15 stack frames

Scenario: Reporting a handled exception's stacktrace
    When I run "NSExceptionShiftScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "Tertiary failure"
    And the exception "message" equals "invalid invariant"
    And the "method" of stack frame 0 equals "__exceptionPreprocess"
    And the "method" of stack frame 1 equals "objc_exception_throw"
    And the "method" of stack frame 2 equals "-[NSExceptionShiftScenario causeAnException]"
    And the "method" of stack frame 3 equals "-[NSExceptionShiftScenario run]"

Scenario: Reporting handled errors concurrently
    When I run "ManyConcurrentNotifyScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 8 elements
    And each event in the payload matches one of:
        | exceptions.0.errorClass | exceptions.0.message |
        | FooError                | Err 0   |
        | FooError                | Err 1   |
        | FooError                | Err 2   |
        | FooError                | Err 3   |

Scenario: Reporting handled errors concurrently in an environment without background thread reporting
    When I run "ManyConcurrentNotifyNoBackgroundThreads"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the error reporting API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"
    And the payload field "events" is an array with 8 elements
    And each event in the payload matches one of:
        | exceptions.0.errorClass | exceptions.0.message |
        | BarError                | Err 0   |
        | BarError                | Err 1   |
        | BarError                | Err 2   |
        | BarError                | Err 3   |
