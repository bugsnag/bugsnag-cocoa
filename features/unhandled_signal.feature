Feature: Signals are captured as error reports in Bugsnag

  Background:
    Given I clear all persistent data

  Scenario: Triggering SIGABRT
    When I run "AbortScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "AbortScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGABRT"

    # Being addressed in PLAT-5861
    # On ARM the stack looks like:
    #   __pthread_kill
    #   pthread_kill
    #   abort
    #   -[AbortScenario run]
    #   ...
    #
    # On Intel, "pthread_kill" does not appear in the stack trace:
    #   __pthread_kill
    #   abort
    #   -[AbortScenario run]
    #   ...
    And the "method" of stack frame 0 equals "__pthread_kill"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGABRT"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGABRT with unhandled override
    When I run "AbortOverrideScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "AbortOverrideScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGABRT"
    And the "method" of stack frame 0 equals "__pthread_kill"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is false
    And the event "severityReason.unhandledOverridden" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGABRT"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGPIPE
    When I run "SIGPIPEScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGPIPEScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGPIPE"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGPIPE"

  Scenario: No error should be reported if SIGPIPE is ignored
    Given I run "SIGPIPEIgnoredScenario"
    And I wait to receive a session
    And I relaunch the app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGPIPEIgnoredScenario"
    Then I should receive no errors

  Scenario: Triggering SIGBUS
    When I run "SIGBUSScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGBUSScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGBUS"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGBUS"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGFPE
    When I run "SIGFPEScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGFPEScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGFPE"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGFPE"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGILL
    When I run "SIGILLScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGILLScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGILL"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGILL"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGSEGV
    When I run "SIGSEGVScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGSEGVScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGSEGV"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGSEGV"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGSYS
    When I run "SIGSYSScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGSYSScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGSYS"
    And the event "severity" equals "error"
    And the event "unhandled" is true
    And the event "severityReason.type" equals "signal"
    And the event "severityReason.attributes.signalType" equals "SIGSYS"

  Scenario: Triggering SIGTRAP
    When I run "SIGTRAPScenario" and relaunch the crashed app
    And I configure Bugsnag for "SIGTRAPScenario"
    And I wait to receive an error
    Then the error is valid for the error reporting API
    And the error payload field "events" is an array with 1 elements
    And the exception "errorClass" equals "SIGTRAP"
