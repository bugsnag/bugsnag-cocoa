Feature: Reporting out of memory events
    If the app is terminated without either a reported crash or a "will
    terminate" event, and the underlying OS and app versions remain the same,
    it is likely that the app has been killed.

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the foreground
        When I crash the app using "OOMScenario"
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive a request
        And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
        And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
        And the exception "errorClass" equals "Out Of Memory"
        And the exception "message" equals "The app was likely terminated by the operating system while in the foreground"
        And the event "unhandled" is true
        And the event "severity" equals "error"
        And the event "severityReason.type" equals "outOfMemory"
        And the event "app.releaseStage" equals "beta"
        And the event breadcrumbs contain "Crumb left before crash"

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the background
        When I crash the app using "OOMScenario"
        And I put the app in the background
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 0 requests

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the background and reportBackgroundOOMs is true
        When I crash the app using "ReportBackgroundOOMsEnabledScenario"
        And I put the app in the background
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive a request
        And the request is a valid for the error reporting API
        And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element
        And the exception "errorClass" equals "Out Of Memory"
        And the exception "message" equals "The app was likely terminated by the operating system while in the background"
        And the event "unhandled" is true
        And the event "severity" equals "error"
        And the event "severityReason.type" equals "outOfMemory"
        And the event "app.releaseStage" equals "beta"
        And the event breadcrumbs contain "Crumb left before crash"

    Scenario: The OS kills the application after a session is sent
        When I crash the app using "SessionOOMScenario"
        And I wait for 2 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 3 requests
        And request 0 is a valid for the session tracking API
        And request 1 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And request 2 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 0 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 1 for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 equals the payload field "sessions.0.id" of request 0
        And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 equals the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 2

    Scenario: The OS kills the application after a session is stopped
        When I crash the app using "StopSessionOOMScenario"
        And I wait for 2 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 3 requests
        And request 0 is a valid for the session tracking API
        And request 1 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And request 2 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 0 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session" is null for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 equals the payload field "sessions.0.id" of request 0

    Scenario: The OS kills the application after a session is resumed
        When I crash the app using "ResumeSessionOOMScenario"
        And I wait for 2 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 3 requests
        And request 0 is a valid for the session tracking API
        And request 1 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And request 2 is a valid for the error reporting API
        And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 0 for request 1
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.handled" equals 1 for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.events.unhandled" equals 1 for request 2
        And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 equals the payload field "sessions.0.id" of request 0
        And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 equals the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 2

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the foreground when reportOOMs is false
        When I crash the app using "ReportOOMsDisabledScenario"
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 0 requests

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the background when reportOOMs is false
        When I crash the app using "ReportOOMsDisabledScenario"
        And I put the app in the background
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 0 requests

    Scenario: The OS kills the application in the background when reportOOMs is false and reportBackgroundOOMs is true
        When I crash the app using "ReportOOMsDisabledReportBackgroundOOMsEnabledScenario"
        And I put the app in the background
        And I wait for 4 seconds
        And I relaunch the app
        Then I should receive 0 requests
