Feature: Session Tracking

Background:
    Given I set environment variable "BUGSNAG_API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"

Scenario: Launching using the default configuration sends a single session
    When I run "AutoSessionScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the session tracking API
    And the "Bugsnag-API-Key" header equals "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
    And the payload includes app and device data
    And the payload field "notifier.name" equals "iOS Bugsnag Notifier"

    And the session "user.id" equals "123"
    And the session "user.email" equals "joe@example.com"
    And the session "user.name" equals "Joe Bloggs"

Scenario: Configuring user info sends it with manually captured sessions
    When I run "ManualSessionWithUserScenario"
    And I wait for a request
    Then the request is valid for the session tracking API

    Then I should receive 0 requests

Scenario: Encountering a handled event during a session
    When I run "AutoSessionHandledEventsScenario"
    And I wait for 3 requests

Scenario: Encountering an unhandled event during a session
    When I crash the app using "AutoSessionUnhandledScenario"

    Then request 0 is valid for the session tracking API
    And request 1 is valid for the error reporting API

    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 elements
    And the session "id" is not null
    And the session "startedAt" is not null

    And the payload field "events" is an array with 1 element for request 1

    And the payload field "events.0.session.id" of request 1 does not equal the payload field "sessions.1.id" of request 0

Scenario: Encountering handled and unhandled events during a session
    When I crash the app using "AutoSessionMixedEventsScenario"
    And I relaunch the app
    And I wait for 3 requests
    Then request 0 is valid for the session tracking API
    And request 1 is valid for the session tracking API
    And request 2 is valid for the error reporting API

    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 element
    And the session "id" is not null
    And the session "startedAt" is not null

    And the payload field "sessions" is an array with 1 element for request 1

    And the payload field "events" is an array with 3 elements for request 2
    And each event with a session in the payload for request 2 matches one of:
        | class     | handled | unhandled |
        | FirstErr  | 1       | 0         |
        | SecondErr | 2       | 0         |
